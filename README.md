# Data Analysis - Boston Crimes

<br/> Given a dataset of Boston's crime report system, answer to the questions located at **2i_ergasia.pdf** and visualize results. All the documentation is included in **exercise.ipynb**.<br>

**Questions**:
- Present the graphs that show the number of crimes per year, month and day as well as the number of crimes per district.
- By studying the data find the year and the district with the most shootings.
- Using the info from the column 'HOUR', make a new column 'Day or Night'. Do most crimes occur during daytime or nighttime?
- Combine the new column with the 'OFFENSE_CODE_GROUP' and find the most common crime place.
- Using the 'Lat' and 'Long' columns and the KMeans library make a **clustering** according to geographical position (and with column combinations)
- **Bonus**: Using the **folium** library (https://github.com/python-visualization/foliumâ€‹) make an **interactive map** that will present the clusters for a particular case.
